# CIRBE-Classifier

As an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Zhang's Space Plasma Lab at UTD, I collaborate with UCLA to analyze data from CubeSatsâ€”small satellites about the size of a Rubik's cube. My project focuses on plotting CubeSat data in magnetic latitude (MLAT) versus flux and using these plots to train a machine learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize electron precipitation patterns. 

I implement these machine learning algorithms using Python in Jupyter Notebook, which has led to a 15% increase in classification accuracy and improved detection of magnetosphere events. By automating the analysis of over 100 CubeSat datasets, this work enhances space weather forecasting and advances our understanding of magnetospheric processes.
